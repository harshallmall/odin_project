    <img src="../images/quiche_lorraine.jpg" alt="Quiche Lorraine">
    <p>Classic comfort dish from the Lorraine Region of France. 
        Originally, the dish was made with eggs, cream, and lardons. 
        In English-speaking countries, the lardons were substituted with bacon.</p>
    <p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 to 8 pieces thick-sliced bacon</li>
            <li>An 8-inch partially cooked pate brisee placed on a buttered baking sheet</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of pepper and nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4><i>Serves 4 to 6</i></h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat Oven to 375 degrees.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Slice bacon into 1/4 inch pieces and brown lightly in a frying pan. 
                Drain and spread in bottom of blind-baked pate brisee.
                Beat eggs, cream, and seasonings in a bowl to blend.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Just before baking, pour cream mixture into the shell, filling to within 1/8 inch of the top. 
                Cut butter into bits and distribute over the cream.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in upper third of oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until quiche has puffed and browned, and a small knife, plunged into custard, comes out clean. 
                Serve hot, warm, or cold; quiche will sink slightly as it cools.</li>
        </ol>
